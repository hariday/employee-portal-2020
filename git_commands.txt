to intialize .git where all projects are kept (project directory)
git init
git config --global user.name hariday
git config --global user.email kannoujia.hariday@gmail.com
git add <file_name>   #to stage specified file at a time 
git add . # to add all files in current directory at a time
git commit -m "commit message"

###to add local repository to remote repository

git remote add origin https://github.com/hariday/employee-portal-2020.git
# Sets the new remote
$ git remote -v
# Verifies the new remote URL
# Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
$ git push origin master(if not work then      $git push origin master --force)

###to create branch
To create a new branch (local branching)and switch to it at the same time, you can run the git checkout command with the -b switch:
The following commands are used for creating the local branches:

$ git checkout -b <branch_name>
Ex .
Switched to a new branch "test2020"
This is shorthand for:
$ git branch test2020
$ git checkout test2020

This is followed by creating remote branches:
$ git push origin test0120
$ git push origin dev0120


##Rename branch
1. Rename your local branch.
If you are on the branch you want to rename:
git branch -m new-name
Ex . 
git branch -m test0120

If you are on a different branch:
git branch -m old-name new-name

2. Delete the old-name remote branch and push the new-name local branch.
git push origin :old-name new-name

3. Reset the upstream branch for the new-name local branch.
Switch to the branch and then:
git push origin -u new-name
